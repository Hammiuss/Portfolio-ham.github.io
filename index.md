### Hi, I'm Aiham
Welcome to my ICS4U portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections. (And rant about Github)

## Highlights
- 🔧 Project 1: Github Pages Portfolio – Made a portfolio using github for the first time, learnt to edit themes, and the general jank of Github
- 🧠 Concept I learned: How to make Github not remove your bones
- 📝 Blog/Reflection: [Reflection #1](./posts/first_reflection.md)

## About me
I deeply hate github, and enjoy ping pong
